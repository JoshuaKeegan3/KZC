# Team details

The KZC project team has 6 team members.

- Benjamin Sanson (Ben)
- Joshua Keegan (Josh)
- Julius Rieser
- Geoffrey Gunawan
- Quinn Hart
- Felix Nagel

The goal of KZC is to produce a game that has the same appeals as Call of Duty Zombies with a light hearted candy tone.

## Communication

Face to face meeting is the preferred method of communication, where that is not available, the team can use [the team discord](https://discord.com/channels/1007808724141879447/1007808724141879450) which is managed by Julius.


## Meetings/availability

[This spreadsheet](https://myvuwac-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sansonbenj_myvuw_ac_nz/EQzN8NV-VAlIs6tmDgyqKc8BKjr1Sq7HDi_zcDdErHLcXw) contains the availability of the individual team members.

Based on the timetables, all 6 team members should be able to meet at:

- Wednesday 1:30pm to 3:30pm
- Friday 4:30pm to 6:30pm

Development meetings will be held at Te Aro Campus WG401
Meetings will be in CO242A and CO242B which are the designated meeting rooms. 
If those arn't available we will try to book a library room. 
If those arn't available we will go will go to CO246


There may be other times where several team members may be able to work together that can also be used.

When meetings do occur someone should take notes of what happens during the meeting, an place a meeting summary in the /team/meetings/ folder.<br>
Typically this would be the job of the Owl.<br>
The value of recording meetings is that it creates persistence, ideas and design decisions won't be forgotten after the meeting. 

## Roles

Team roles are used to help the team function together. A well functioning team may not need the animal model. A dysfunctional team can be helped by using the 6 animal model.

## Working in Unreal Engine together

Because Unreal Engine Blueprints are binary files, we need to be careful to not overwrite each other's work. A filecheck out policy is needed where only one team member can be working on a file at once. If two team members work on a blue print and merge their work into main, the first team member's work will be overwritten. 

Work on *uasset files must be sequential, with one team member working on a Blueprint at a time.

## Moving between Te Aro and Kelburn campusses

It is possible to walk between the two campusses by taking [this route](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Te+Aro+Campus+Vivian+Street,+Te+Aro,+Wellington/Victoria+University+of+Wellington,+Kelburn,+Wellington/@-41.2928627,174.7699763,16z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d38afd8ff4b2b09:0xab444ccb54096e1c!2m2!1d174.7755893!2d-41.2953307!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d38b02952575dbb:0xadf3ba89622116f0!2m2!1d174.7678789!2d-41.2901075!3e2)

The walk takes _~20-25_ minutes depending on traffic lights. Googles time is inaccurate.

There is also the number _18_ bus which goes from Kelburn to Te Aro. The journey takes ~13 minutes

The bus comes every 20 minutes at xx:09, xx:29: xx:49
